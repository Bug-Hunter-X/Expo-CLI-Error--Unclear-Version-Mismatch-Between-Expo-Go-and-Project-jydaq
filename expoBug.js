This error occurs when using the Expo CLI and it involves a mismatch between the version of Expo Go installed on your device and the version specified in your project's `app.json` or `expo.json` file.  The Expo CLI might try to start a project with features or dependencies that your installed Expo Go app doesn't support, resulting in this cryptic error message.  Often, there's no clear indication of what version mismatch is causing the problem.
