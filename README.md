# Expo CLI Version Mismatch Error

This repository demonstrates a common but difficult-to-diagnose error in the Expo CLI. The issue stems from a version mismatch between the Expo Go app installed on a user's device and the project's configuration (specified in `app.json` or `expo.json`).

## Problem

The Expo CLI may throw vague or unhelpful error messages when the installed Expo Go version is incompatible with the project's requirements.  This prevents the app from launching correctly.

## Solution

The solution involves verifying the Expo Go version and updating it if necessary. The project's configuration may also need adjustments to match the available Expo Go version.  In some cases, a clean reinstall of Expo Go or even the project's dependencies may be required.
