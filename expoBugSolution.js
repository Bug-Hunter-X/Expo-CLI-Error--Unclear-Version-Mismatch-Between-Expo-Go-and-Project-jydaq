The solution involves a multi-pronged approach:

1. **Check Expo Go Version:** On your device (iOS or Android), check the version number of your Expo Go app.  
2. **Check Project Configuration (`app.json` or `expo.json`):** Look for SDK version specifications (e.g., `"sdkVersion": "48.0.0"`). This version should generally match (or be backward compatible) with the Expo Go app version.
3. **Update Expo Go:** If your Expo Go version is outdated, update it via your device's app store.
4. **Update Expo CLI:** Ensure you have the latest version of Expo CLI installed (`npm install -g expo-cli`).
5. **Clean Install:** As a last resort, try deleting your project's `node_modules` folder and re-installing your dependencies (`npm install`). You may also consider completely deleting and recreating the Expo project to resolve any lingering configuration conflicts.
6. **Verify Compatibility:** Check the Expo release notes to ensure there are no known compatibility issues between your SDK version and the Expo Go version.

Example Code (Illustrative, no direct error shown, focus is on version management):

```javascript
// app.json or expo.json
{
  "expo": {
    "sdkVersion": "48.0.0"
  }
}
```
